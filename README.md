# 🔥❄️ Min2345’s Hot & Cold Number Guessing Game 🎯

Welcome to **Min2345’s Hot & Cold Number Guessing Game**!  
This is a simple, interactive number guessing game where players try to find a secret number using **hot and cold feedback** instead of “too high” or “too low”.

The closer you get, the hotter it feels. Guess wrong, and things get cold.

## 🔥❄️ Guess Feedback System

After each guess, the game responds with:

- **🔥 Hot** – You’re very close to the number  
- **🌡️ Warm** – You’re getting closer  
- **❄️ Cold** – You’re far from the number  
- **🎉 Correct** – You guessed the number  

No “too high” or “too low” hints.  
Only distance-based feedback.
